And then you have a couple of options that are specifically related to stage events.  There's your on stage change and your on stage selected.  
Your on stage changes are going to occur whenever the stage of a business process flow changes. 
 So this could occur by a user clicking the next stage button or moving to the previous stage in that business process flow or programatically switching stages if you have 
 code that is executing.  The on stage selected option occurs when the stage of a business process flow has actually been selected.  So these are some of the options that you 
 have available from an event standpoint to be able to attach scripting to within Dynamics CRM.
